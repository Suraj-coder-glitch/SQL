    "2. FOREIGN KEY\n",
    "Purpose: Ensures the value in a column matches a value in another table‚Äôs primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used for: Creating relationships between tables (referential integrity).\n",
    "syntax\n",
    "FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. UNIQUE\n",
    "Purpose: Ensures all values in a column (or a group of columns) are unique.\n",

    "Unlike PRIMARY KEY: Allows NULL values (unless specified otherwise).\n",
    "syntax\n",
    "email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE\n",

    "###Q3Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify\n",
    "your answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The NOT NULL constraint is used to ensure that a column cannot have a NULL value, meaning that the field must always contain valid data. Here's why it's important:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to Use NOT NULL:\n",
    "1.Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevents incomplete or missing information in important fields (e.g., names, IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Business Rules Enforcement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some data is essential (e.g., an employee name or product price). Applying NOT NULL enforces this logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Avoid Errors in Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many operations (like calculations or joins) behave unexpectedly with NULL values. NOT NULL helps prevent that.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Improved Indexing and Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexes on NOT NULL columns may perform better, especially in certain databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
    "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justification:\n",
    "Uniqueness Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key must uniquely identify each row in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "NULL represents ‚Äúunknown‚Äù or ‚Äúmissing‚Äù data ‚Äî it cannot be reliably compared, so it breaks uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOT NULL is Implicit in PRIMARY KEY:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define a column as a PRIMARY KEY, SQL automatically applies a NOT NULL constraint to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY\n",
    "Is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "emp_id INT NOT NULL UNIQUE\n",
    "Standard SQL Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the SQL standard and behavior in most RDBMS (like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), primary keys must not contain NULLs.\n",
